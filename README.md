# Sinatra Portfolio Project

# Overview

This is my submission for the Sinatra Portfolio Project. The application is called "Vertex Games", and its about having a user create an account and post any number of lists about their favorite or least favorite games onto their page.

Their post will also be posted on the index page where you can see all the users posts, starting from the most recent one. The user can update, and delete a post. This is an application where people can see what games are popular these days.

# Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repo on your ide and run bundle install. After that, all you need to do is run shotgun and paste the route that is given to you to the web browser.
